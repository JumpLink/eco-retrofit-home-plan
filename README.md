# Eco Retrofit Home Plan

## About the Project

Welcome to the **Eco Retrofit Home Plan** project! This open-source initiative documents the complete energy-efficient and sustainable transformation of a family home. The project emphasizes:

- **Sustainability:** Minimizing environmental impact through renewable materials and efficient designs.
- **Ecological Building Materials:** Utilizing clay, lime, straw, wood fiber insulation, and Schaumglasschotter.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Developing innovative heating systems (e.g., wall and floor heating) and insulation techniques.
- **Open Knowledge Sharing:** Providing tools, plans, and documentation to inspire and assist others.

> **Note:** This project is focused on the retrofit of an existing home, not new construction. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are highly encouraged.

## Features

- **Architectural blueprints** created with Home Sweet 3D, shared for transparency and collaboration.
- **Heating system plans** tailored for maximum energy efficiency in retrofitted buildings.
- **Material recommendations** that prioritize ecological sustainability and CO₂ reduction.
- **Scripting tools** to calculate insulation thickness, heating surface requirements, and other key metrics.
- **Interactive GitHub Pages site** for easy access to documentation, videos, and calculation tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Software:** [Sweet Home 3D](https://www.sweethome3d.com/) (free and open-source) for architectural blueprints.
- **Development Tools:** Node.js (for running TypeScript scripts locally, optional).
- **Basic Knowledge:** Familiarity with sustainable building practices (optional but helpful).

## Features of the GitHub Page

The project includes an interactive **GitHub Pages** site where users can:
- Browse project documentation and plans.
- Access video tutorials and progress updates.
- Use calculation tools directly on the site, such as:
  - Heating surface requirements based on insulation and room size.
  - Insulation thickness estimations based on material properties.
